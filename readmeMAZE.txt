If you want to add a new map you have to save it as [A-Za-z_]*.txt in ./'maps' dir, and take care about let blank spaces at the end of the line. All the lines need to have the same length.

The walls always has to be 'X'. You need to specify where to START with a 'S', and where it ENDS with a 'O', you can use as example the default map.
